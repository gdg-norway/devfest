Read full version.
DevfestNorway Team prides itself on being an open, respectful, and inclusive community. That means jerky behavior isn’t allowed at DevfestNorway meetings. Because we know that it’s not obvious to everyone, here’s a reminder of the things we don’t allow: jokes or offensive comments about sex/sexuality/race/religion/nationality/body size, showing porn in public, touching people uninvited, or continuing to interact with someone after they’ve asked you to stop.</description></item><item><title>FAQs</title><link>/faq/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/faq/</guid><description>General What is Devfest Norway?
